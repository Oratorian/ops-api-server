# OPS API

**OPS API** is a modular, secure, and rate-limited backend service designed to manage and monitor. It enables fine-grained control over access and concurrency while supporting extensible system endpoints for infrastructure orchestration.

## 🚀 Overview

This service acts as an intelligent access gateway, making it ideal for scenarios requiring:

- Secure token generation and revocation
- Controlled rate-limited usage patterns
- Service monitoring and automated restarts
- Lightweight deployment with strong modular separation

Whether you're building internal developer tools, automating DevOps pipelines, or protecting microservices, OPS API offers the foundation.

## 🔑 Features

### 🔐 Key Management
- **Generate Keys:** Issue new API keys via secure endpoints.
- **List Active Keys:** View currently issued keys and metadata.
- **Revoke Keys:** Instantly deactivate any API key.

### 🧠 Rate & Concurrency Limiting
- **Rate Limiting:** Throttle requests by key to prevent abuse.
- **Concurrency Controls:** Cap simultaneous operations per client.

### 🛡 System Operations
- **Service Restart Endpoint:** Trigger backend service restarts remotely.
- **Health Endpoint:** Check live status for uptime monitoring or alerting systems.

### 🧹 Modular & Maintainable
- Fully separated routes for each function
- Lightweight utility modules for scaling or customization
